Prerequisites \u00b6 You will need Python installed - all supported versions of Python should work. Quickstart \u00b6 Install using pip or pipx . $ pip install vfx-seqtools or $ pipx install vfx-seqtools This will provide the command-line utilities: seqchk - check frame sequences in the current directory for file consistency. seqcp - copy frames according to provided name patterns and frame range. seqdo - do command(s), substituting in the provided frame range. seqexp - expand a frame sequence, to evaluate it visually. seqgen - make a frame sequence from a list of framenumbers. seqls - list frame sequences in the current directory. seqmv - move (rename) frames according to provided name patterns and frame range. seqrm - remove (delete) frames according to provided name patterns and frame range. Examples \u00b6 See examples.md for more examples. Changes \u00b6 See the product Change Log on GitHub for a history of changes. Problems? \u00b6 Please submit issues on GitHub.
